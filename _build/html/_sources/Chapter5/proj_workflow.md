# Project Workflow

Get excited friends, because it's time! In this Chapter we're going to get our hands dirty working with the actual steps you might encounter when taking on a real project in the field.  Just like with CRISP-DM, there are some pretty well-known and ordered steps we're going to introduce.  You won't always need each phase, but it's an excellent general structure to be aware of so you can take what you need and adapt to whatever your situation is.

It's funny how easily I can recall the feeling just prior to kicking off a new project.  Nervous tension building because I knew I was going to impress everyone with how I solved this complex problem that no one else could.  So exciting!  I can also just as easily recall the feeling of that awesomeness slowly morphing into something a little more resembling nausea after I came to realize I really had no idea _how_ I was going to solve the problem, seeing all of the problems with the data, dealing with the challenges of working with a difficult business sponsor, and constantly being beaten over the head with reminders of our tight project management deadlines.  

Don't worry.  I'm only kidding.  Sort of.

My wife can't stand puzzles.  There isn't really a strong enough word to describe how much she dislikes them.  She loves the feeling of accomplishment, but would rather not struggle to get there.  Seems so strange to me.  Being a data scientist is absolutely not for her.  Me on the other hand.  I love the feeling of challenging myself with the impossible.  Somehow it makes the satisfaction of accomplishment that much sweeter.

Anyone else really want to try this puzzle, or is it just me?

If the image of this puzzle doesn't turn your stomach, then you might be one of us.  Or if you're someone who loves a difficult challenge and gets excited about trying to do something that everyone else tells you is impossible, then welcome.  You're going to love it here.

Don't say I didn't warn you though.  As fun and exciting as our work can be, it can often be just as frustrating and difficult when you actually get into it.  You'll have constant challenges.  You'll hit impassable roadblocks.  You'll be stuck in a seemingly endless cycle of trial and error.  But remember, there's a totally worthwhile payoff somewhere in there when you do figure it out.  I promise.
