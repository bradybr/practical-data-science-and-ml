It's always fun to get your hands on the data and start playing around, but once you start seeing all of the problematic challenges lurking about that need your attention, it's very easy to get burned out and start looking for any excuse to move on.  Null values are not sexy.  Missing records are not exciting.  Duplicate observations are not fun.  But all of them are important to deal with, trust me.\n",
