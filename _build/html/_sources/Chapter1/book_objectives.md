# Objectives

As a practicum and secondary level education course, we must be intentional in the material we aim to cover.

Students will have fulfilled the minimum mathematics requirements in algebra, probability, and statistics prior to this course, but are unlikely to have been exposed to the more robust math and theoretical concepts required for mastery of these subjects.  In addition, special coding skills are required to accomplish the hands-on work, which our students are likewise unlikely to possess at this time.  Lastly, due to the restrictions of time, there's only so much we could reasonably expect to cover during a semester.

Taking all of this into account, the following are our objectives for this course.

1. Create a foundational understanding of Data Science and Machine Learning concepts
2. Advance from novice to intermediate skills in Python, NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn programming
3. Develop an experiential understanding of the business applications and value potential for these concepts and skills

```{note}
Effort has been made to motivate examples with foundational mathematics and theory whenever possible; however, the major themes for this secondary education level course are 1) Introductory exposure to Data Science concepts, and 2) Solving real-world business problems through the application of these concepts.  As a consequence, in-depth discourse may be deferred in favor of contextual understanding.
