Does this sound like something you might have said?

Perhaps you're the lucky adolescent with an early understanding of where you're headed after you leave high school.  Or maybe you're the type of above average scholar that can be introduced to a new topic, and then easily wrap your mind around the real-world applications and why you might care about a subject.  Congratulations if this describes you.  Unfortunately for me, it did not.

At your age I was largely going through the motions.  I had no idea what I was learning, but more importantly _why_ I was supposed to care about learning it.  Even during my university years, my academic pursuits were still mostly driven by what I thought I was supposed to be doing, which in my case was getting a business degree like my father.  Interestingly enough, an important point is obvious to me now.  My goal was obtaining a degree.  Not learning, not finding a subject I was passionate about, and certainly not figuring out what I wanted to do with my life.  It was _get a general business degree, and then take any entry-level job that would have me_.

During my early years I was more of an average underachiever, mostly interested in the social aspects of youth.  The toll this took on my potential became apparent over time.  I felt average in intelligence and apptitude.  Neither stellar nor dim, just average.  In retrospect, now I can clearly see it was more a function of my age and general apathy towards applying myself.  I strongly believe certain people simply aren't mature enough in their formative years to put this life puzzle together at that time.  In my case, it took a little more life experience and good fortune when I made a professional acquaintance who introduced me to a career path that finally resonated with me:  Data Science.

Before getting ahead of myself, let me say there's absolutely nothing wrong with general business degrees or entry-level business careers.  Nothing wrong at all if that's what you're interested in, but _not_ because it's a path of least resistance like it was for me.  This is a road to stagnation and lost time.  And none of this is to say you _should_ have all of this figured out at your age.  The point is,

Life is long with many chapters, but the sooner you're able to find your path and realize your full potential, the more fun it will be.

Revisiting my quote about never using what I learned in school when I get out into the world, let me assure you I've been proven wrong many many times.  Would you believe I actually needed to convert a slope coefficient into degrees using arctangent and pi?

$$
\arctan(slope) * (180 / pi)
$$

The context for needing to use this formula was when I was working on predicting corn prices in the futures commodities market.  Using slope alone, I was not able to make comparisons of price movements in relation to a common horizontal plane.  I needed angle degrees to understand and compare the severity of the historical price advances and declines.  So what you may still be asking?  Well, trillions of dollars are traded in the futures markets every day, and if you're able to be even moderately good at predicting prices, then you will be one rich data scientist my friend.

It's still just more math theory and memorization though without telling you the _why_ behind why I needed to convert these numbers into degrees.  If math theory gets you excited, then that's awesome!  Run with it!  I would wager that for the majority of students though this is not the case.  For you other students, maybe this real example helps put it in context a bit and sparks some interest in _applied_ theory.

Bringing all of this full circle, my aim in creating the content for this course is to pay my success forward.  For the last 10 years I've been working as a Data Scientist for the largest food manufacturer on the planet, and I've had an abundance of opportunities to work on exciting and meaningful projects all around the world.  It doesn't feel like work if you love what you do, and if I can afford that same feeling to just one person by starting them on this path, then it will be time well spent.  Data Science will not be for everyone, but this sneak peek may appeal to some of you early enough to set you off on an intentional path towards taking the next steps in your development.

I hope you enjoy the material and it piques your curiosity.  Good luck, wherever your path takes you!
