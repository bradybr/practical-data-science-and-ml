    "Supervised Learning is a collection of techinques revolving around the idea of learning from historical observations where you know the answer.  For example, imagine you have a data set consisting of many individual dogs and cats, one animal per row, with characteristics of each individual such as height, weight, tail length, nose length, ear length, etc.  In addition, for supervised learning you should expect some \"truth\" label that tells you the classification, or answer, for whatever you're interested in predicting.  In this case, it would be a column named \"Specie\", which holds whether each animal is a dog or cat.  Our algorithm would then learn which features allow us to separate between dogs and cats, which we could subsequently use to make predictions on new examples where we _do not_ know the answer, whether it's a dog or cat.  Unsupervised Learning is similar, in that our algorithms look for relationships and patterns, however here we do not have a ground truth label to learn from.  And lastly, we've already discussed Reinforcement Learning briefly.  These are generally more optimization and sequential learning tasks under uncertainty.\n",

Seems pretty obvious to us today, but did you know that it wasn't until 1954 that scientists were able to satisfingly prove the causal releationship {cite}`Mendes_2014`?  It's a high bar to say something _causes_ something else from a statistical point of view.\n",

We'll cover this in greater detail when we get to other data science personas and roles, but for now understand that someone on the data science team will need to own building, testing, deploying, and maintaining the final solution the team has built.  \n",
