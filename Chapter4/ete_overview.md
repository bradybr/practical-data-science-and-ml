# End-To-End Overview

Being truly great at something is an interesting thing.  Consider the dedication and effort it takes to become really amazing at something?  Like the best in the world.  All of the amazing feats of human accomplishment, innovation, and achievements we tend to revere as a society, are often born from obsession.  Someone, or a group of people, were so singularly focused devoting an unbelievable amount of time towards their endeavor that the results can be staggering, and sometimes paradigm shifting.  These achivements often come at great personal expense unfortunately.  Think Bobby Fischer of the chess world, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak with Apple, or Albert Einstein.  Most people simply aren't willing to put in that kind of ruthless dedication to become the world's best at something.

I find the subject of becoming truly great at something super interesting, but I digress.  I actually have a point here.  When you find something you enjoy doing, spend a lot of time becoming good at it, you tend to want to do it.  When you want to use a hammer, everything looks like a nail.  In our context, this means we often get so excited about being able to solve a challenging and cool problem that we fail to devote enough time to proper due dillegence for the project ideation, condsideration, and valuation steps.  We want to just get right to solving the problem after hearing the idea.

Luckily there are some well known frameworks and standard operating procedures we can leverage to make sure we're working on the right things, and that we're reducing the chances of surprises down the road.




No one ever says today I'm going to build the worst thing ever today.
