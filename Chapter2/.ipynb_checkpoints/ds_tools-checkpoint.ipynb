    "The early practitioners had it easier in my opinion.  You would have most likely come up through a mathematics, engineering, or science department at university and learned how to use a commerical software tool during that time (whichever was paid for by your university).  Post graduation, you would have found a company using the software you learned and then you would have been all set for a career.  End of story.\n",

    "Time carries on as it tends to do however, and leaves quite a wake in the world of technology.  Open source communities hit their stride and began to seriously change the game in the mid 90's to early 00's.  If you're not familiar with the term _open source_, let me explain.  It essentially means the source code of the program, which allows it to do what it does, is available for you do see, modify, and/or distribute under its license, all for free.  This is in stark contrast to commerical applications which cost money to use, usually not an insignificant amount I might add, and you're generally not allowed to view or modify how it works.  There are communities of users who maintain these open source code repositories with a rigorous testing and comittal process, but the general idea is to leverage the synergy of active users contributing to the functionality of the language or tool.  The benefits and the ways these communities have changed the world around us cannot be overstated.\n",

Before Python took over the world a few years ago, R was the go-to open source data science language.

Unfortunately I was allowed to get away with it because I was one of the first in my organization to start working in data science so we didn't have the architectures fully stood up yet, and frankly no one new any better at that time anyway.
