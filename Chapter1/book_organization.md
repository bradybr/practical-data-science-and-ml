# Book Organization

The organization for the material follows a natural progression from introductory and expository, to practical use.

**Chapter 2** <br>
Is designed to introduce the reader to basic definitions and concepts.  The _what_, we are talking about in this course.  There are lots of new terms and buzz words in this field and it's easy to get confused.  Here we introduce the essential subsets of study and try to explain some of the overlap and distinctions between the fields.  We'll also cover the various roles and personas involved with data science and machine learning, discuss how they work together, and what kind of knowledge and tools are involved.

**Chapter 3**<br>
Jumps straight into a few examples to give the student a taste of why this field can be so exciting.  Every single day people are interacting with these inovative programs potentially without even being aware they exist.  We hope to get the creative wheels turning quickly by showcasing how data science is changing the world, in small ways and large.

**Chapters 4-5**<br>
Opens the door to the common steps of an actual machine learning project.  There's nothing but possibilities and different ways to solve each problem we'll come across, but these are the well understood steps we should familiarize ourselves with for consideration.  Here we'll cover the best practices and most common things you'll want to be aware of when tackling building a solution.

**Chatper 6**<br>
Begins the hands-on modeling now that we've been given a taste of what machine learning can do.  Here we begin to learn some of the basic mathematics, theory, and methodologies data scientists work with.  These are the fundamental building blocks required to make use of these powerful tools.  We won't be able to become masters in our understanding of these topics in this short discourse, but it's critical we discuss some special theorems and topics as best we can.

**Chapter 7**<br>
Goes deeper yet with common math theory and methodologies we should get to know.  All of the methods we've worked with so far can be better understood and utilized if you grasp some of the core concepts underneath the hood.  These will be indispensible understandings and tools as you begin to solve real problems.  

**Chapters 8**<br>
Summary, recommendations, and next steps.
